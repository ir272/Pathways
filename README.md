# Pathways

## Inspiration

We noticed the search for opportunities is broken: students who truly need programs and scholarships can't find them, and on top of this, they're hard to find and oftentimes not a match.

## How It Works

Based on a short survey about financial need, accessibility, and learning preferences, our algorithm creates you an "Inclusivity Index" score. This score will match you with scholarships and other programs that match your qualifications and needs. Users can save opportunities, track deadlines, and stay organized, saving hours of manual research.
